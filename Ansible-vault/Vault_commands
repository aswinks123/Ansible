Ansible Vault is a feature in Ansible that allows you to encrypt sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, or any other confidential information within your playbooks or variable files. 

1. Creating an encrypted file
ansible-vault create secrets.yml (for new file)   or ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml(for encrypting an existing file)

2.Edit the Encrypted File
ansible-vault edit secrets.yml

3. Viewing the Contents of an Encrypted File
ansible-vault view secrets.yml

4. Decrypt an encrypted file
ansible-vault decrypt secrets.yml

5 . Running Playbooks with Encrypted Files
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass # give --ask-vault-pass when a playbook has encrypted files or content included.

6. Reference a secret with password file
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --vault-password-file=password.txt
Note: file should contain the password without any leading or trailing whitespace.

7. Change the password of an encrypted file
ansible-vault rekey secrets.yml #Enter old and new password
